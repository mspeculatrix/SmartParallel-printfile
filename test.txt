A long paragraph. This is intended to test how the program splits on spaces between words. The paragraph is more than 264 characters long - ie, longer than two 132-column lines, as 132 is the longest line the Epson MX-80 F/T III printer can accommodate. The program offers options to split on spaces or not. In the latter case, it will simply split at the number of columns specified - 80 by default and 40 or 132 as options, the first being 'double' mode and the second 'condensed' mode on the Epson.
